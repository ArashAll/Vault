OpPrevx 2010

Prevx was an aggressively advertised fake security product developed by same name company.
Company response on OpPrevx was pathetic crying all over wilderssecurity forums (product main promotion platform), weak trolling attempts by development, manager(!) and customers staff alongside with totally incompetent and useless fixes.

Product development stopped after acquiring, and to the final build they were unable to retaliate.
